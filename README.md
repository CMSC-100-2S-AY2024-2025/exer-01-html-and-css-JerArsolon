Steps on how to create GitHub page:
1. Accept the assignment given by our lab professor.
2. Clone the remote repository to our local machine and setting our username and email to track changes who pushed changes to the remote Git repository.
3. Change the visibility of our GitHub repository to public and switch to the branch where we want to push our static website.
4. Finally we can see our link in the Settings>Pages part of our remote repository.

What are your key takeaways from this exercise?:
My key takeaway from this exercise is that version control is really useful because we can easily track what we did before and create a new branch to safely modify any part of our code without worrying if it will work or not, since we can always revert to the previous branch. Also, GitHub Pages is pretty useful because it allows us to host our static webpage for free.
